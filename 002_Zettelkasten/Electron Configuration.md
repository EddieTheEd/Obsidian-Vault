# Electron Configuration:


**Valency:**
* The **combining power** of an atom, is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine/displace.
* **Valency vs Valence electrons**
	* Valence def stated above, whereas Valence electrons refer to the **number of electrons** in an atom's Valence (outer) shell.
	* e.g. Nitrogen: Valency of 3(-), but has a number of Valence electrons of 5.
* **Principal quantum shells** â€“ the shells of an atom. 
	* e.g. Sodium's principal quantum shells are 2, 8, 1.
* **Nuclear attraction:** Effective nuclear attraction is derived by substracting the number of inner (core) electrons (which 'shield' the valence electrons) from the nuclear charge of an atom (how many protons in an atoms nucleus)

**Electronegativity:** a higher density of atoms? ==research this==


**'-'block elements:**
* To be an 'x'-block element, the **outer subshell** must be an 'x' shell (x being s, p, d or f)
* E.g. Argon's electronic configuration (using spdf notation) is:
	* $1s^22s^22p^6$
* Here, the last subshell is a p subshell. Thus, Argon is a **p-block element**.

Good Resources to Review:
* **any** worksheets given by Ms Pilling
* **research similarities / differences of flame test to AAS**
