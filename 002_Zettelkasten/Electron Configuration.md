# Electron Configuration:


**Generic Electron Configuration**:
* This is the basic electron configuration that you are taught in Yr 8
* Essentially, the first shell of an atom can hold 2 electrons.
* The second shell can hold 8 electrons.
* The third shell **usually** holds 8 electrons, however it has space for 10 more.
* The formula $2n^2$ describes the **total possible electrons in an electron shell**.
	* Here, n represents the **principal quantum number**, or the **energy level notation**.

**Subshells - Electronic Configuration:**
* Electrons are arranged in energy levels or shells
* Energy of shells increases as distance from nucleus increases.
* n is the principle quantum number which shows energy
* The maximum number of each shell is $2n^2$

* Shells are divided into **sub-shells**.
* n = 1 has a single s subshell
* n = 2 has s **and** p subshells
* n = 3 has s, p and d subshells
* The subshells are:
	* **s, p, d, f**


* The 's' subshells holds a maximum of 2 electrons.
* The 'p' subshells holds a maximum of 6 electrons.
* The 'd' subshells holds a maximum of 10 electrons.
* The 'f' subshells holds a maximum of 10 electrons

**Valency:**
* The **combining power** of an atom, is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine/displace.
* **Valency vs Valence electrons**
	* Valence def stated above, whereas Valence electrons refer to the **number of electrons** in an atom's Valence (outer) shell.
	* e.g. Nitrogen: Valency of 3(-), but has a number of Valence electrons of 5.
* **Principal quantum shells** â€“ the shells of an atom. 
	* e.g. Sodium's principal quantum shells are 2, 8, 1.
* **Nuclear attraction:** Effective nuclear attraction is derived by substracting the number of inner (core) electrons (which 'shield' the valence electrons) from the nuclear charge of an atom (how many protons in an atoms nucleus)

**Electronegativity:** a higher density of atoms? ==research this==


**'-'block elements:**
* To be an 'x'-block element, the **outer subshell** must be an 'x' shell (x being s, p, d or f)
* E.g. Neon's electronic configuration (using spdf notation) is:
	* $1s^22s^22p^6$
* Here, the last subshell is a p subshell. Thus, Argon is a **p-block element**.

**Recall:** Aufbau's principle!!!! There is not a linear direction to the spdf blocks. 

This is because, **certain subshells dont have (sorta) consistent levels of energy.**

![[Aufbau Principle.png]]

E.g. Titanium: $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}3s^{2}3p^{6}4s^{2}3d^{2}$

Here, the **4s** subshell has a lower energy than the **3d** subshell, thus we write it first.

**Isoelectronic species** - chemical species that have the same number of electrons/ same electronic structure/ same electronic configuration

* In general, this applies when atoms have the same electron configuration, but varying atomic mass (e.g. S-2 and Ar)

**Absorption and Emissions Spectrum:**
* Bohr's model describes the existence of **absorption/emissions spectra**.
	* *From the idea that electrons occupy energy levels, and can be excited to higher energy levels
* An absorption spectra represents **different wavelengths of photons being absorb**
* Absorption and emissions spectrum (of the same species) will **always superimpose exactly**.
* **Every elements spectrum is unique!**
	* In a spectrum, the intensity of a spectra indicates the abundance of an element.
	* We use this to identify **concentration** in a mixture.

Good Resources to Review:
