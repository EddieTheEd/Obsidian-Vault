# Electron Configuration:


**Valency:**
* The **combining power** of an atom, is equal to **the number of hydrogen atoms** it could combine/displace.
* **Valency vs Valence electrons**
	* Valence def stated above, whereas Valence electrons refer to the **number of electrons** in an atom's Valence (outer) shell.
	* e.g. Nitrogen: Valency of 3(-), but has a number of Valence electrons of 5.
* **Principal quantum shells** â€“ the shells of an atom. 
	* e.g. Sodium's principal quantum shells are 2, 8, 1.
* **Nuclear attraction:** Effective nuclear attraction is derived by substraction

Good Resources to Review:
* **any** worksheets given by Ms Pilling
* **research similarities / differences of flame test to AAS**
