This is where I store my Year 10 notes, and a bunch of other random stuff

Here's a quick(*broad*) list of all the subjects included:

- Chemistry (Yr 11)
- Chemistry (Yr 10)
- Methods (Yr 10/11)
- Spec (Yr 11)
- Chinese (Yr 10)
- *English (Yr 10/11) - Note: these notes are very bad, and the majority of these 'notes' are my assessments*

If you have any notes related to these subjects, and you are willing to share it with me, feel free to email me at edwardleehuynh@gmail.com .
