# IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ!!!
--- 
As of 3/06/2022,

I will be reformatting the obsidian vault for a ~~week or two~~ **multiple weeks (3-4 as of 18/06/2022)**. Please don't try pulling anything, I will be making specific folders and rewriting this readme so that there are some proper instructions. 

Thanks, Ed

## UPDATE! (25/06/2022)

yep im still working on it

I'm trying to optimise the vault for my own personal use and productivity. Don't read my stuff.

In other words, since the filing system is essentially intact, anyone who wants to contribute notes can place their files in the 
"004_ContributedNotes" section.

# Overview
This is where I store my Year 10 notes, and a bunch of other random stuff. See below to understand how to open the vault properly, and how to format your pull requests.

Here's a quick(*broad*) list of all the subjects included:

- Chemistry (Yr 11)
- Chemistry (Yr 10)
- Methods (Yr 10/11)
- Spec (Yr 11)
- Chinese (Yr 10)
- *English (Yr 10/11) - Note: these notes are very bad, and the majority of these 'notes' are my assessments*

If you have any notes related to these subjects, and you are willing to share it with me, feel free to email me at edwardleehuynh@gmail.com .

# How to use

1. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), install and open it. You should see something like this.

2. Download **ALL** the files and folders in the [GitHub page](https://github.com/EddieTheEd/Obsidian-Vault). It is best to use GitHub's inbuilt zip function.

3. Unzip the folder. You should then get a folder that looks like this.

4. Go back to the Obsidian window. Press the Open button.

5. Select the folder **inside** the folder you just unzipped.

7. You will probably get some error messages regarding GitHub or discord. Those are for the plugins I've installed, you can either ignore them or uninstall the plugins from the community plugins tab (Ctrl + <, Community Plugins)

### **Congratulations, you now see almost exactly what I see! You have access to the Graph view (Ctrl + G), and can see all the links between the notes in the vault. You also have a downloaded copy of the markdown files. Use them however you see fit.**
