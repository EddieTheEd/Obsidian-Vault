Q1. Weight is the effect of gravity on an object's mass. Therefore, if mass remains constant, then only gravity will affect mass. In comparison to Earth, the moon has a much weaker gravitational pull. Thus, your weight on the moon is a lot less in comparison to when on the Earth.
Q2. Due to inertia, objects will remain in motion unless an outer force acts upon them. Thus, when the bus stops the passengers inside are still going in a forwards motion. This causes them to move forwards until the force is balanced.
Q3. According to Newton's 1st Law of Motion, stationary objects remain stationary unless an external unbalanced force acts upon them. In this scenario, although the car is accelerating, I am still a stationary object, until the car's motion acts upon me. This causes me to appear to move backwards, however I am gaining momentum as my motion balances with the cars motion, from a point of stationary movement to an equal motion inline with the car.
Q4. 1. Use smoother surfaces, reduce contact between two surfaces, reduce pressure/weight on the surface

Q10.
