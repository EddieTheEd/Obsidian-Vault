**Solubility Curves:**
* Solubility curves show the solubility of substances as temperature changes.
* Generally, the solubility of ionic solids increases with temperature. This is because there is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid.

**Chromatography:**
- An *analytical* technique
- Graphite does not dissolve in aqueous or organic solvents. Therefore, we use graphite as the material of our line of origin in paper chromatography.
- Do not add any extra variables, time between chromatograms should be constant.
- 2 Principles:
	- Capillary action still draws the solvent up the matrix, however while the molecules in paper chromatography are separated based on mass, in TLC, separation often depends upon solubility or charge, due to the interaction of solute and matrix.
	- A dry sample is played in the silica gel matrix. As the solvent front moves up the gel, it dissolves the sample and carries it up the matrix with it.
