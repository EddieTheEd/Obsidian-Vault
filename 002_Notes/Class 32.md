**Solubility Curves:**
* Solubility curves show the solubility of substances as temperature changes.
* Generally, the solubility of ionic solids increases with temperature. This is because there is more energy to overcome bonding in the solid.

**Chromatography:**
- An *analytical* technique
- Graphite does not dissolve in aqueous or organic solvents. Therefore, we use graphite as the material of our line of origin in paper chromatography.
