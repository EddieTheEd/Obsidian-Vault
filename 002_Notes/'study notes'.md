# 'study notes'

work on a task for 25 minutes, 5 min break, repeat 4 times then 15-30 break

make a schedule/routine

time-blocking , break up your days into blocks

**HOW TO SKIM:**

-   Read headings
-   Read intro
-   First last sentence of each following paragraph
-   Bold words + charts
-   Conclusion

make a list of what you got wrong in multi-choice, reflect on questions you got wrong, why did oyu get it wrong and what you will do to avoid it - write it?

short time limits for anythings, parkinson’s law

to-do list:

-   not broad
-   give clear idea of what to do
-   e.g. “study exam” bad, “study chapter 1” good

test yourself while studying!!

use that anki memorization technique - spaced repetition

somehow integrate that into study??

best times to study (cram the big stuff here):

10 Am - 2pm

4 pm - 10pm

**Take a break while reading - 10-15 min, reflect on important details**
