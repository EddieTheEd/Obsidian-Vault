If you're reading this:
	Hello! You're inside my brain right now. Must feel pretty cool, huh?
	Anyway, the whole point of this conversation right now is so that I can discuss with you how I'm going to organise this obsidian vault.
	Essentially, what I want to do is have *subject tags*, and *project tags*.
	**Subject tags** will be used to identify specific subjects, e.g. Chemistry Yr 11, Methods Yr 11 etc.
		>Update: uhh I've kinda messed up all the tags so the plan has changed: subject tags will only tag subjects, which will have their own organisational divisions for topics etc.
	**Project tags** are for personal projects of mine, e.g. Notes.exe which needs a better name.
	That's essentially it! If you want to see these tags, download obsidian and open this as a vault.
	Also, there'll be a literal #subject tag to identify subjects.
Extra Clarification:
	The Notes.exe project is essentially me reviewing my previous notes and synthesising them into quality notes that I can distribute (for cash, hopefully jk jk)
**UPDATE:**
	If you're wondering wtf is happening with all the new templates and folders, I'm trying to use Obsidian for daily notes + personal management instead of Notion. It should all be nicely cleaned up in a few weeks.
