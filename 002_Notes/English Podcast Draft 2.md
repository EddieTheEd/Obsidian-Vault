**Host:** Hey there! It's the Independent Informers here on  the 11th of May, 2017 and we are extremely grateful to have guest speaker Hải Minh Nguyễn on our podcast. Being considered a 'boat person' himself, his bestseller "A Soulless Ocean" has brought to light the struggles that countless families bravely endured for a chance at a new life in Australia. Hải Minh, what do you think about Dutton's recent zero-tolerance policy of boat refugees?

**Hải Minh:** It's frankly outrageous. I find it difficult to believe that Australia, one of the strongest democracies in the free world, could implement such an unsympathetic border policy. I can still remember the journey my family took to leave Vietnam. When the North seized Saigon, they took everything away from us. 

**Host:** That sounds horrible. Please continue.

**Hải Minh:** They took all our belongings from us. So we gathered as many valuables as we could find, and my father paid for a boat to Australia. For those saying that we took the coward's way out, I assure you this was more punishment than escape. Any family I had back in Vietnam are either dead or lost to me. 

(Storm music)

The voyage was agonising, with the waves thundering like the artillery shells back at home. It was as if I had never left. The boat would be constantly barraged by the violent rage of the ocean. The suffocating winds of salt was overwhelmed by the smell of vomit and mould. This was a struggle that everyone onboard experienced, for months on end. Not everyone made it through. My grandmother would pass away a few kilometres from the shores of Australia.

**Host:** I'm deeply sorry for your loss.

**Hải Minh:** She was one of the lucky ones. She was buried in Australia. Those that died before would be thrown into the sea. Their graves being the vast waterbed of the Pacific. Our family went through all this pain and suffering, just to make it to Australia. To have a new life, one free from authority. For them, the risk of dying thousands of kilometres away from home was worth it. 

(Western music plays)

**Host:** Truly tragic. I hope you've found peace with her passing. Now, take a look at this picture.

**Host:** What do you think of this photo?

**Hải Minh:** It's an unfortunate reality we live in. None of these people want to be refugees. They just want to survive, and have the best opportunity at life. When we send back boats, we are denying refugees their basic human rights to live freely and without persecution. I am fortunate to have had many great moments in my life. But none were as joyous or rewarding when I got off the boat and stepped foot onto an Australian harbour. Having made it through the treacherous journey across the Pacific, I could really appreciate the tranquillity and silence of Australia. The calm tides washing over my feet, the quiet zephyrs dancing around me. 

**Host:** How did you and your family adapt to this new environment?

**Hải Minh:** My family had nothing to their name, so we had to work hard to survive. And we did. We did so with a smile on our face, because we knew the alternative was a cold, bitter life as workers under Vietnam's tyrannical government. 

**Host:** What do you remember of your journey to Australia?

(Traditional Vietnamese song returns temporarily)

**Hải Minh:** Some nights, I can hear the waves crunching in my ears as I sleep. But ever since I stepped on the sands of Australia, the noise has subsided. However, there are some things I miss from Vietnam. If I focus really hard, I can still recall the times when my whole family would sing to me a traditional Vietnamese song, I only have my mother to sing to me now. Sometimes, when I pass by a Vietnamese restaurant, the smell reminds me of my last meal of phở in Vietnam, before all I would smell for months would be stomach fluid and mildew.

(Western song returns)

**Host:** Do you return to the harbour where you first stepped foot in Australia often?

**Hải Minh:** Absolutely. I regularly go back and just sit in the sand with my family. My life in Vietnam ended there, but my life as an Australian began. The restful flow of the waves remind me of my journey, and those I had left behind. Precious memories, falling from my mind and into the ocean like handfuls of sand. I will never forget the first time I grasped the cool, saline sand, it was the day I became Australian.
