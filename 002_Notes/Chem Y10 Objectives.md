**Unit Two: The Periodic Table and Stoichiometry**

_This unit is designed to review, build upon and develop prior learning in Year 8 & 9 Chemistry, with the goal of preparation for ATAR Chemistry success._

**The Big Picture**

Since the earliest days of Chemistry, Scientists have attempted to arrange the elements that have revealed similarities and differences between them. An understanding of the properties of elements and their position in the periodic table can help us appreciate what occurs within a chemical reaction resulting in the rearrangement of these elements within compounds. This can help us explain how chemical reactions are used to produce particular products and how different factors influence the rate of reactions. It is important to appreciate the quantities needed within reactions to get the correct quantities of the products we want.

**Topic:** (italics means extension)

**Periodic Table and Bonding**
1. Describe the work of Dalton, J.J. Thomson, Perrin, Mendeleev, Rutherford, Moseley, Aston, Bohr and Chadwick in the understanding of atomic structure.
2. Explain how electronic structure of an atom determines its position in the periodic table and its properties.
3. Explain what is meant by the term valency and what valence electrons are.
4. Describe how ionic and covalent bonds are formed.
5. Write chemical formulae for ionic and common molecular compounds.
6. _Compare and contrast the properties of a group I element with a group VII element._
7. _Hypothesise as to why elements in group I become more reactive as one moves down the group, whereas group VII elements become less reactive as one moves down the group._
8. _Describe an element that has yet to be discovered, together with its properties and the group it would be found in and consider how it bonded._
9. _Consider the different ways the periodic table can be represented and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each model, e.g. the spiral periodic table, the layered periodic table._

**Types of Reaction**
10. Classify different types of reaction, including neutralisation, combustion, displacement and precipitation.
11. Make predictions about the products for standard reactions, using balanced molecular equations and ionic equations.
12. Define oxidation and reduction in terms of electron transfer.
13. Describe common redox reactions including combustion and displacement, and identify the species being oxidised and reduced.
14. Use the reactivity series to predict the products of a displacement reaction.
15. Recall and describe what a precipitate is.
16. Predict whether a precipitate will form in certain reactions.
17. Describe observations for standard reactions using information on the data sheets.
18. Identify the difference between an observation, a hypothesis and an inference, when conducting investigations.
19. _Write half equations to describe redox reactions._
20. _Quantify solubility of solids and gases using solubility data._
21. _Describe and explain the relationship between solubility and temperature for solids and gases._
22. _Investigate the use of precipitation reactions in industrial processes (eg: water treatment and flocculants)._

**Stoichiometry**
23. Recall how to balance chemical equations.
24. Define the terms mole, Avogadroâ€™s constant, atomic number, atomic mass and molar mass.
25. Build on their skills to solve problems where they need to convert mass to moles, moles to mass and mass to mass.
26. Conduct mole to mole, mass to mole, mole to mass and mass to mass calculations involving gases at standard temperature and pressure.
27. _Conduct calculations of advanced stoichiometry problems including limiting reagent calculations._
28. _Review concentrations and calculate Molarity using no. of moles and volume of water._
29. _Appreciate the importance of empirical formulae to a geologist._
30. _Investigate research taking place with new elements e.g. element 117. Discover how they react and write a report on them._
31. _Reflect on the story found at this site, and summarise the key points of the story. http://www.foxnews.com/science/2012/09/28/elusive-element-113-finally-created-researchers-say/_
