-   **Solution concentration**
-   **Moles per litre (molarity) mol $L^{-1}$:** $c = \frac{n}{v}$

-   **c** is the concentration of solute in moles per litre (mol L-1)
-   **n** is the amount of solute in moles (mol)
-   **V** is the volume of solution (solvent + solute) in litres (L)

-   **Grams per litre g L-1:** $c_{gL}^{-1} = \frac{m}{v}$

-   $c_{gL}^{-1}$ is the concentration of solute in grams per litre (g L-1)
-   **m** is the mass of solute in grams (g)
-   **V** is the volume of solvent (solvent + solute) in litres (L)

-   **Parts per million (by pass) ppm**: $c_{ppm} = \frac{m_{s}\times 10^{6}}{m_t}$

-   **cppm** is the concentration of solute in parts per million by mass (ppm)
-   **ms** is the mass of solute in grams (g)
-   **mt** is the mass of solution (solvent + solute) in grams (g)

Chromatography can be used as a separation technique, or as a technique to identify components of a mixture for further use or for analysis.

Key requirement is that it contains a **stationary phase** and **mobile phase**.

Stationary phase:
- The phase that does not move. Compounds in the mixture are attracted to it (**adsorbed**) and slowed down. Either a solid or a liquid.

Mobile phase:
-
