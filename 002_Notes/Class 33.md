**Gas Chromatography:**
- GC is used widely in many analytical laboratories, including forensic police labs, synthetic chemical labs, and drug testing labs.
- GC uses a stationary phase to impede the movement of a mobile test substance.
- Different substances are attracted to the matrix by different amounts, and therefore journey along it at different speeds.
- In GC, the sample is injected into the machine, where it is vaporised. It is then washed over the matrix by an **inert gas**.
- Some substances will be more attracted to the matrix than others. These will take much longer to reach the detector.
- The detector measures the abundance of a substance at a given time, and this data is plotted on a graph.
- Most polar = one that travels slowest.
