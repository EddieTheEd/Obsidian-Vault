# Chromatography

Chromatography is a laboratory technique for **separation** and **identification**.

Types of Chromatography include:
- **GC/GLC** - Gas (Liquid) Chromatography
- **HPLC** - High Performance Liquid Chromatography
- **Paper Chromatography**
- **TLC** - Thin Layered Chromatography
- *Column Chromatography*

**In all examples of chromatography:**
- There exists a **stationary** and **mobile** phase.
- Separation of substances relies on **solubiilty**.
	- In general, if a substance is more soluble in the mobile phase in comparison to the substance's desire to **adsorb** (bind to a surface) to the stationary phase.

**Paper Chromatography**
- Is used to separate mixtures, especially dyes or pigments.
- Procedure (dyes in ink mixture):
	- We put the mixture on a **line of origin**
		- Note that we do not place the line of origin within the solvent, as the mixture would simply dissolve in the solvent and not move up the stationary phase.
	- Dots of single dyes are placed alongside a dot of the unknown mixture.
	- As the solvent moves up the paper, the pattern of the single dyes can be compared to that of the mixture's pattern.
- The solvent(mobile phase) is drawn up the paper by **capillary action**.
- In general, paper chromatography uses **polarity** of the substances.
	- The chromatography paper (stat. phase) is usually very polar.
	- Polar substances in a mixture will be more attracted to the stationary phase and thus will adsorb and not move with the mobile phase as much.
	- Non-polar substances are less attracted, and thus do not adsorb well and can be dissolved in the mobile phase, and move greatly along with the mobile phase.
- This form of chromatography is most useful if the substances involved have distinct colours.
