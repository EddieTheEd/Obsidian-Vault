==(hook)==
The short story 'Immersion' (2012) by Aliette de Bodard is set in a space dystopia where the Galactic and Rong cultures mimic contemporary issues of racism through the use of Immersers which manipulate appearance to appear ethnically Galactic. Similarly, 'The Pedestrian' (1951) by Ray Bradbury in set in a defunct future of the United States where entire cities spend their nights watching television, and the only citizen who experiences individuality, Leonard Mead, is persecuted.

This presentation of Leonard Mead as alone in the largely populated city he lives in, and his vibrant, humorous dialogue in the presence of an entirely silent community, further promotes the ==importance of human connection in contemporary society==. Thus, through the use of a subtle dialogue enhanced by the lack of a societal response, both texts further promote the significance of human connection to the reader, seeking to challenge the audience's more progressive views on family values.

Both 'Immersion' and 'The Pedestrian' promote a concerned attitude towards society's disregard for individuality. In 'The Pedestrian', Leonard Mead is highlighted as the only person "in a city of three million" who regularly walks down the silent streets of the city, rather than conform to society's expectations of him to spend his nights watching television.
