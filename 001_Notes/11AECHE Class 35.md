**Brønsted–Lowry model:**
- Acids are proton donors
- e.g. HCl can ionise and produce hydrogen ions in aqueous solution
- Thus HCl is an acid.
	- $HCl_{(aq)} \rightarrow H^{+}_{(aq)}+Cl^-_{(aq)}$
	- Better equation: $HCl_{(aq)} + H_{2}O_{(l)} \rightarrow H_3O^{+}_{(aq)}+Cl^-_{(aq)}$
- Monoprotic acids: Acids that produce one proton for every 1 molecule of acid that ionises.
- Sulfuric acid: $H_{2}SO_{4} \rightarrow H^{+}+HSO_4^-$
	- $HSO_{4}^{-}\rightarrow H^{+} + SO_4^{-2}$
- Nitric acid: $HNO_{3(aq)}$

- These are examples of **strong acids.**
- **Strong acids:** ionise completely.
	- We use arrows going in one direction, because all of these molecules in water will ionise
	- There is a difference between strength of acids and concentration of acids.

- **Weak acids:** acids that do not ionise completely (ionise partially).
	- e.g. $CH_3COOH$, $HNO_2$, $H_2SO_3$,
