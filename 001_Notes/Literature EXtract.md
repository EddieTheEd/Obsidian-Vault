**Chapter 1: Solace**
Tears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs. Columbia trotted down the muddy, forsaken pathway, her journey illuminated by the mellow glow of the luscious forest. She quietly stepped towards her destination, holding her breath as the whispers of the wilderness emanated around her. It had been years since she last walked down the path. She had just watched the sun rise, pouring with crimson, alongside her father and mother. The warm, effervescent feeling of anticipation as they headed towards the sparkling waterfall at the end of Lake Erie. 

At last, Columbia had reached the riparian of the lake. She could feel the calm, nascent winds of daybreak rolling over her, drowning her with a serene sensation of tranquillity. She dipped her hands into the water. A bolt of frost shot through her arms, the perspiration of the clouds immediately deepened as the blue above darkened, and divine light struck the lake. Columbia fell away from the water in shock, as the breeze started pushing her into the arms of the forest. She could hear the winds cry out in pain, the once still lake erupting in violent gushes. The wails quickly turned dormant, as the wind halted, and the lake became silent once again. The silence was broken by a faint glistening in the lake. 

Squinting through the moisture in her eyes, Columbia was greeted by the bright, elegant dances of a golden ring's shine, almost entirely submerged in the miry sludge of the lake-shore. With precision, she cautiously grabbed the ring, placing it in the palm of her hand. It had an ethereal quality, yet felt mundane in Columbia's mind. Out of curiosity, she quaintly placed the ring on her scrawny fingers. 

Without hesitation, a wave of discomfort engulfed her body, with every organ of her being shrieking in unknown agony. Before she could react, a visceral stab of agony blinded her. A raw layer of maroon exuded into her vision, as her other sensations dimmed. Columbia fell to the floor, an unknown force compressing her breath ==deep down== her throat. The sharp pain forced her eyes closed, her mind scattered amongst the blotches of agony that erupted through her body. Within a small period of time, all of her being wailed in torment, with Columbia's mind almost unconscious. However, as quickly as the pain shot throughout her body, it disappeared. Columbia opened her eyes, making out her surroundings through her lightly blood-red, obscured vision. A dissonant ringing pierced her eardrums, only to be soothed by a voice she hadn't heard in years.

Columbia turned around ecstatically to see her father. His voice, while distinctly respectable, was distorted beyond her understanding. She saw him ==grasp his rifle tightly==, but when their eyes met, a bolt of sadness struck her heart. There was no soul, or compassion in her father's eyes. It was not unlike cloudy, glass spheres in place of his eyes. She noticed his pale skin, the sweaty flaky hair, and his ==rugged== clothes. With his mouth wide open, he charged into the forest. At once, Columbia followed suit. Dashing through the loose leaves and branches, Columbia kept her eyes trained on the animated body of her father as gunshots rung out around her. In a small opening of the forest, a final, deafening shot oscillated throughout the stale air. Columbia stopped to see her father clasp his chest, with an achromatic liquid exuding into his palms. He quickly rummaged through his left pocket to pull out a silvery locket. Columbia was shocked to see a faint picture of her alongside her father within. With tears flowing from her eyes, Columbia quietly observed as her father pulled the locket to his chest, as the life faded from his body. As raw emotion overwhelmed Columbia, she fell to the ground as her father vanished, sobbing furiously.

In the distance, the gentle birdsong of the forest was interrupted by a staggering, dissonant shriek. Columbia hurriedly turned to see herself on the bank of the lake in the embrace of her mother, surrounded by a group of British soldiers. Her face had crumpled up in despair, as her mother pointed to a small wooden boat, that she would often play with under the supervision of her parents. Columbia tearfully watched herself climb into the boat, as her mother stood strong and fought off the soldiers until they drew their swords and slashed at her chest, and like her husband, she collapsed and laid in a pool of the same colourless fluid. Peering over the heads of the soldiers, Columbia saw herself frantically setting sail her fragile boat, and drift into the distance. 

She took off the ring, and a shade of light crimson lifted from her eyes. She approached the lake, throwing it into the deep end of the water, and watched as it elegantly sank beyond her vision. She dived into the lake, and with fluid style floated gently at the surface.
