Tears of dew silently fell from the azure clouds, gently carried by the dance of zephyrs. Columbia trotted down the muddy, forsaken pathway, her journey illuminated by the mellow glow of the luscious forest. She quietly stepped towards her destination, holding her breath as the whispers of the wilderness emanated around her. It had been years since she last walked down the path. She had just watched the sun rise, pouring with crimson, alongside her father and mother. The warm, effervescent feeling of anticipation as they headed towards the sparkling waterfall at the end of Lake Erie. 

At last, Columbia had reached the riparian of the lake. She could feel the calm, nascent winds of daybreak rolling over her, drowning her with a serene sensation of tranquillity. The perspiration of the clouds deepened, as the blue above darkened, and divine light struck the lake. Columbia sprung away from the water, as the breeze started pushing her into the arms of the forest. She could hear the winds cry out in pain, the once still lake erupting in violent gushes. The wails quickly turned dormant, as the wind halted, and the lake became silent once again.
