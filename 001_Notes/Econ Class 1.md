# Econ Class 1

First assessment wk 5 for content in wk 1 - 4

Supply and demand mainly affects global prices despite of the price of its components

e.g. oil price dropped, but petrol price is still high
	due to demand for petrol
	cost is related to cost for refining oil made months ago

Trade is how we achieve economic growth
- side-effect: also comes with standard of living
- free markets

In economics you should:
- adopt different perspectives when analysing situations
- evaluate the benefits and costs of individual and social choices
- examine and understand how certain events and issues are related

Economics is the:
- "Science of wealth"
- "Study of mankind in the ordinary business of life"
- "...examines the part of the individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being"
- "A study of human behaviour as a relationship between ends (which we want) and scarce means which have alternative uses."

**Scarcity is important**
- **Relative** scarcity in particular
- Things are scarce but only relative to what we want to use them for
- "The study of how men allocate their scarce resources to provide for their wants." (J Harvey)
*Scarcity: Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)*

**Two main branches of economics:**
- **Microeconomics**
- **Macroeconomics (what we do now**

The **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP) 
- Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)
- Additionally, resources have alternative uses

**Relative scarcity: based on relationship between wants and resources**

```ad-important

**Resources are scarce relative to the demand for goods and services**
```
- Relative scarcity means that we do not have enough resources to satisfy all our wants and needs.
- Are there goods that have no cost?
- What are examples of free goods?
- No and no.
- Free goods are goods which have no **price**, no **property price**, and require no **factors of production for enjoyment**.
- NO goods are free (except things like air/sunshine)
- All goods have an **economic** cost.
- Due to scarcity, people are forced **to make choices**.
	- Wood is scarce. Can be used for furniture items, pencils, etc.
	- Time is scarce. It can be used for any welfare enhancing activity - study, work etc.
	- Resources cannot be used for **all wants** **at the same time**.
	- We need to **CHOOSE**.
- *Scarcity* -> *Choice* -> *Consequences*
												-> *Opportunity cost*
- When a choice is made, it involves a sacrifice known as an **opportunity cost.**
```ad-important
**Opportunity cost is the real cost of the next best alternative (in the scale of preference) that is forgone in order to obtain more of something else.**

```

Resources have **alternative uses**, but,
```ad-important
These alternative uses have **varying degrees of efficiency**.
When moving resources around, efficiency may be affected, and **the output may be affected**.

**Coronavirus:**
•The world today is suffering from shortages across multiple sectors.

•What is being affected?
- Travel
- Maritime trade
- Building
- Labor markets
- Agriculture/Horticulture
- Medicine/Hospitality
- Transport
- Mining
- Retail industry
- Fast food industry
- Airlines
- Groceries
- Stock market? (specific goods related)

•How is this manifesting in society?
- Builders have gone bankrupt because high labour costs, cost of materials, transport costs
- There's less patrons in the airports, bags are being lost
	- Cancelled flights, prices are increasing
- 

•Why did the supply chains function so well pre covid and what is the problem during Covid?
- Production efficiency, as it was running smoothly before the pandemic
- Lack of resources slow it down

•What is the cause of the supply shortages?
- Lack of willing employees for the supply chain industry
- Lack of resources
- Effects of quarantine laws
•How does this relate to the basic economic problem?
- The weakened supply chain reduces the supply for specific resources throughout global populations, increasing demand and cost
- People will make choices to protect their survival (generally), and less important goods/services such as entertainment services (Netflix) will lose the most business.
