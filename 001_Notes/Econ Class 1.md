First assessment wk 5 for content in wk 1 - 4

Supply and demand mainly affects global prices despite of the price of its components

e.g. oil price dropped, but petrol price is still high
	due to demand for petrol
	cost is related to cost for refining oil made months ago

Trade is how we achieve economic growth
- side-effect: also comes with standard of living
- free markets

In economics you should:
- adopt different perspectives when analysing situations
- evaluate the benefits and costs of individual and social choices
- examine and understand how certain events and issues are related

Economics is the:
- "Science of wealth"
- "Study of mankind in the ordinary business of life"
- "...examines the part of the individual and social action which is most closely connected with the attainment and with the use of material requisites of well-being"
- "A study of human behaviour as a relationship between ends (which we want) and scarce means which have alternative uses."

**Scarcity is important**
- **Relative** scarcity in particular
- Things are scarce but only relative to what we want to use them for
- "The study of how men allocate their scarce resources to provide for their wants." (J Harvey)
*Scarcity: Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)*

**Two main branches of economics:**
- **Microeconomics**
- **Macroeconomics (what we do now**

The **Basic Economic Problem** (BEP) 
- Insufficient resources available (limited resources) to produce all that people desire (unlimited wants)
- Additionally, resources have alternative uses

**Relative scarcity: based on relationship between wants and resources**

```ad-important

**Resources are scarce relative to the demand for goods and services**
```
- Relative scarcity means that we do not have enough resources to satisfy all our wants and needs.
- Are there goods that have no cost?
- What are examples of free goods?
- No and no.
- Free goods are goods which have no **price**, no **property price**, and require no **factors of production for enjoyment**.
- NO goods are free (except things like air/sunshine)
- All goods have an **economic** cost.
- Due to scarcity, people are forced **to make choices**.
	- Wood is scarce. Can be used for furniture items, p
	- Time is scarce. It can be used for any welfare enhancing activity - study, work etc.
