# Water Quality

sadly this exists

### Key Messages + 1 Section
- Strict water quality controls are in place to protect human health and aquatic ecosystems from **chemical and biological pollutants**.
- In general, control of pollutants at their source is more effective than remediation because of their persistence in the environment and concentration through the food chain.
- Elevated levels of:
	- salinity
	- nutrients
	- metals
	- pathogens
	- organic contaminants (e.g. pesticides)
- result in low water quality in Australia
- **Pollutants** result from agriculture, industry and urban areas (wide range of souces) (most prevalently ag + urb, due to **catchment land use**)
- Sediment layers at the bottom of waterways are a major sink for nutrients and contaminants, which can be released into waters and become toxic under certain conditions.
- New contaminants, for example pharmaceuticals, are continually emerging and much monitoring and research is focused on detecting their presence and toxicity in aquatic environments.

- Either water treatment or the protection of sources (e.g. water supply catchments for Perth)
- Pollutants may enter the food chain 
	- -> fisheries depend on water quality
	- -> agricultural productivity may be affected
	- -> some aquatic ecosystems may be damaged due to low water quality

**Main nutrients in water:**
- phosphorus
- nitrogen
- cations
- trace metals
- biological constituents (living things)

- Physical properties of water (temp, light penetration(?)) affect survivability of aquatic organisms

e.g. Dams release water into rivers **from the top**, as the lower-most water is too cold/deprived of oxygen.

- Ecosystems adapt to **natural water quality**
	- **Changes in water quality** can greatly affect survivability/life

**Pollution:**
- Can result from changes in the naturally occurring concentration of some components in water
	- e.g. nutrient levels too high, algae grows toxically
	- Most commonly, oxygen levels go too low
- Also result from man-made constituents that do not naturally occur in water 
	- e.g. pharmaceutical products leak into river

**Steps to manage pollution in river basin/groundwater system:
- Define use/value of water + risk to said use/value due to pollution
- Sources of pollution should be identified (+pathways in which the pollution may reach the water)
	- For large water supply catchments, there may be multiple sources, and pollutants (chem/bio only) can transform as they are transported
		- e.g. herbicides can degrade to be harmless, thus they only act as pollutants close to the water source
- Targets for water quality are set, and actions to achieve them
- Water quality should be monitored so pollution risks can be identified, and to evaluate effectiveness of present pollution management strategies.
- Water from **point source pollution** (when pollutants are discharged e.g. pipe, factory) has improved recently due to better regulations. 
	- This is an example of effective pollution management strategies.

**Examples of point source pollution**
- Industrial plants
- Hospitals
- Sewage treatment plants
- Mine sites

- Widespread pollution of water from usage of land where water is collected (**catchment land use**) is hard to combat 
	- This is currently the biggest water pollution problem today
- **Examples of catchment land use** are for agricultural and urban land use.

**Examples of pollution from catchment land use**
- Salt 
- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Suspended sediment (?)
- Note that some are **natural constituents** of water, therefore the concentration required to prevent ecological damage are variable (+ hard to determine)

### Salinity

- Affects a lot of agriculture.
- Salinity is ultimately caused from rainfall (ocean spray in rainfall)
	- Salt accumulates in soil

**How to reduce**
- Revegetation of water catchments
- Using pastures (grazing land for animals) 
	- both need large areas
- **Salt interception schemes** pump salt to be evaporated/stored
- Quality irrigation practices

	
















# Acid sulfate soils explained

Common in many parts of the world, acid sulfate soils are saturated with water, almost oxygen-free and contain microscopic crystals of iron sulfide minerals (commonly [pyrite](https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/soil/soil-testing/soil-terms)).

Acid sulfate soils are safe and harmless when not disturbed. If acid sulfate soils are dug up or drained they come into contact with oxygen. The pyrite in the soil reacts with the oxygen and oxidises.

This process turns pyrite into sulfuric acid, which can cause damage to the environment and to buildings, roads and other structures.

The acid also attacks soil minerals, releasing metals like aluminium and iron. Rainfall can then wash the acid and metals from the disturbed soil into the surrounding environment.

- Types of chemical contaminants:
	- Heavy metals
	- Pollutants from fertilisers
	- Organic pollutants

- Heavy metal contamination
