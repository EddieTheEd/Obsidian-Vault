# Water Quality

sadly this exists

### Key Messages + 1 Section
- Strict water quality controls are in place to protect human health and aquatic ecosystems from **chemical and biological pollutants**.
- In general, control of pollutants at their source is more effective than remediation because of their persistence in the environment and concentration through the food chain.
- Elevated levels of:
	- salinity
	- nutrients
	- metals
	- pathogens
	- organic contaminants (e.g. pesticides)
- result in low water quality in Australia
- **Pollutants** result from agriculture, industry and urban areas (wide range of souces)
- Sediment layers at the bottom of waterways are a major sink for nutrients and contaminants, which can be released into waters and become toxic under certain conditions.
- New contaminants, for example pharmaceuticals, are continually emerging and much monitoring and research is focused on detecting their presence and toxicity in aquatic environments.

- Either water treatment or the protection of sources (e.g. water supply catchments for Perth)
- Pollutants may enter the food chain 
	- -> fisheries depend on water quality
	- -> agricultural productivity may be affected
	- -> some aquatic ecosystems may be damaged due to low water quality

**Main nutrients in water:**
- phosphorus
- nitrogen
- cations
- trace metals
- biological constituents (living things)

- Physical properties of water (temp, light penetration(?)) affect survivability of aquatic organisms

e.g. Dams release water into rivers **from the top**, as the lower-most water is too cold/deprived of oxygen.

- Ecosystems adapt to **natural water quality**
	- **Changes in water quality** can greatly affect survivability/life

**Pollution:**
- Can result from changes in the naturally occuring concentration of some components in water
	- e.g. nutrient levels too high, algae grows toxical
