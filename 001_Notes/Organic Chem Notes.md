### Key Definitions
- *Organic Chemistry*: The study of carbon-containing compounds (e.g. $CH_4$)
- *Fractional Distillation*:
	- **Short Answer:** A type of distillation (separation technique for **miscible**(dissolve in each other) liquids), that utilises slight differences in boiling points.
	- **Long Answer (AKA un-edited/irrelevant)**: 
		- Used when separating mixtures with similar boiling points
		- In general, the path that the boiled products take to reach the condenser is extended, or surface area is increased, usually through the use of glass beads
		- In theory (Kinetic theory of gas particles), the lower-boiling liquid will have a lot of kinetic energy, whereas the higher-boiling liquid will have less as it approaches its boiling point but does not completely reach or exceed it. The increase in surface area makes it more likely for the higher-boiling liquid to lose its energy and fall back down as a liquid.
		- *E.g.* if you have 2 liquids with boiling points 65 and 75, and you place it in a fractional distillation apparatus that boils at a temperature of 70, the 65-liquid would be in a temperature that exceeds their boiling points, so they would have a lot of energy (higher temperatures causes gasses to move faster), so they are much more likely to be able to reach the top due to their high kinetic energy. The 75-liquid would not be as highly charged, however a small portion of its particles may become gaseous. However, the increase in surface area creates a large chance that these particles will hit into the surface area, and as they donâ€™t have much energy they will fall back down as a liquid.
- *Functional group*: A group of ==covalently bonded== atoms that can replace a hydrogen atom in an organic compound. These groups tend to influence the overall chemical properties of the molecule they are bonded to.
	- It also defines the structure of families of compounds
- *Homologous series*: A group of compounds with a common functional group, branched or unbranched.
	- They may also differ by a molecular formula of $CH_2$ (e.g. $CH_4$ and $C_2H_6$ differ by $CH_2$, thus they are of the same **homologous series**)

### Key Ideas
- *Background Information*: Covalent bonding is the electrostatic force of attraction between a shared pair of electrons (known as a bonding pair) and the nuclei.  Atoms can share multipe
- **Fractional Distillation**:
	- Uses marginal differences in boiling points between 2 or more miscible liquids
	- Uses:
		- Purification of water
		- Separation of water from ethanol
		- Crude oil refining
- Hydrocarbons refer to organic compounds that contain both carbon and hydrogen atoms.
- Carbon atoms have a **valency of +4 (and -4)**. To obtain a stable electron configuration, carbon tends to bond covalently, and does not form ionic compounds as a result of its valency of +4. 
	- Carbon atoms covalently bond in the following ways:
		- Forming 4 single bonds
- Organic chemistry heavily relies on the **IUPAC naming system**. The IUPAC naming system aims to give us crucial information on the structure and properties of an organic compound.
	- For example, **methane**:
		- **meth**: indicates that the **main chain** of carbons only contains 1 carbon atom.
		- **ane**: indicates
		-
